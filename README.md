Aim: To create a security camera using raspberrypi

#Jun 2020: Using ultrasonic sensor to detect any inteference within set distance - Not accurate and not able to detect past door.

#Oct 2020: Used PIR sensor to detect movement. Much more accurate readings with less False Positives.

#Todo: Object recognition. Try to recognise human and chart down in/out timings. To study parcel delivery timings.
